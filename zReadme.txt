## Overview
This project is a sports management database for tracking teams, players, games, and player statistics in a local league. It includes SQL scripts to create and populate the database, calculate team ratings, and generate a top goal scorers report.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Prerequisites**:
   - MySQL installed (e.g., MySQL Community Server).
   - MySQL Workbench or another MySQL client.

2. **Import the Database** (Option 1 - Using Dump File):
   - Open MySQL Workbench.
   - Go to Server > Data Import.
   - Select "Import from Self-Contained File" and choose `LocalSportsManagementSystem_Dump.sql`.
   - Import the database. This will create the `LocalSportsManagementSystem` database with all data.

3. **Manual Setup** (Option 2 - Using Individual Scripts):
   - Create the database:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE LocalSportsManagementSystem;
     USE LocalSportsManagementSystem;


Save this file in your project folder.

### Step 4: Package the Project
Compress the project folder into a single file for easy sharing:
1. **On Windows**:
   - Right-click the `LocalSportsManagementSystem` folder.
   - Select **Send to** > **Compressed (zipped) folder**.
   - This creates `LocalSportsManagementSystem.zip`.
